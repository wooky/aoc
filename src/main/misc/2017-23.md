## Solution 1
The only place a multiplication is being done is in the inner loop #1.
* At the start, `b = 93` and `c = b = 93`.
* Inner loop #1 is iterated `b-e` times. With `e = 2` always, it becomes 93-2 = 91 times.
* Inner loop #2 is iterated `b-d` times. With `d = 2` always, it becomes 93 - 2 = 91 times.
* Inner loop #3 (i.e. outer loop) is iterated once, since `g = b - c = 0` and the loop is exited when `g == 0`.

Therefore, multiplication is being done 91 &times; 91 &times; 1 = 8281 times.

## Solution 2
After observing how the code runs, it was determined that it's trying to find how many composite (i.e. non-prime) numbers exist between `b` and `c` (inclusive) with steps of 17. Since `a != 0`, `b` is 93 &times; 100 + 100000 = 109300 and `c` is 109300 + 17000 = 126300.

Nim code:
```nim
var nonPrimes = 0
for i in countup(109300, 126300, 17):
  block attempt:
    for j in 2 .. i/%2:
      if i %% j == 0:
        nonPrimes += 1
        break attempt
echo nonPrimes
```
Outputs 911.
