Problem: vzbxkghb

Considering that the problem has no illegal letters, but also doesn't have an
increasing straight or repeating letters, we can fulfill all the requirements
by having the last 5 letters be in the form 00122. The 5th last letter is x, so
we can set the last 5 letters to xxyzz, making the next password
  >> vzbxxyzz

xyz is the last increasing straight we can make in the alphabet, so we increment
the 6th last letter. This allows the last 5 letters to use the smallest possible
combination, which is aabcc. Hence, the next passwod becomes
  >> vzcaabcc
